# localos_private_ip (Data Source)

`private_ip` data source gets information about all the network interfaces attached to the machine that reads the data source. All discovered interfaces except loopback are returned, as loopback is well known.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "localos_private_ip" "my_ips" {}

output "primary_ip" {
  description = "IP of NIC connected to default gateway"
  value       = my_ips.primary.ip
}

output "primary_cidr" {
  description = "/32 CIDR of NIC connected to default gateway"
  value       = my_ips.primary.cidr
}

output "primary_name" {
  description = "Interface name of NIC connected to default gateway"
  value       = my_ips.primary.name
}

output "primary_network" {
  description = "CIDR range of network to which NIC connected to default gateway is part of"
  value       = my_ips.primary.name
}

# "secondaries" is a list of all other local NICs found, not including loopback adapter
# Attributes for each list entry are the same as for "primary"

output "first_secondary_ip" {
  value = my_ips.secondaries[0].ip
}
```

## Schema

- `id` (String) Resource identifier
- `primary` (NIC) Primary NIC is defined as the locally attached interface which has the route to the default gateway (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--nic))
- `secondaries` (List of NIC) All other NICs (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--nic))

<a id="nestedatt--nic"></a>
### Nested Schema for `NIC`

NIC represents a locally attached network interface.

Read-Only:

- `cidr` (String) - /32 CIDR of the interface
- `ip` (String) - IP Address of the interface
- `name` (String) - Interface name of the interface
- `network` (String) - CIDR range of network to which the interface is connected
